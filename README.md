## Usage

### Base Docker Compose

FlyWP has a base Docker Compose configuration for running MySQL, Redis, Ofelia, and Nginx Proxy that are shared for all sites hosted on the server. The base Docker Compose must be started before a site can be created.

```bash
fly base start              # starts the base services (mysql, redis, nginx-proxy)
fly base stop               # stops the base services   
fly base restart            # restarts the base services
```

### Site Operations

You can run the following commands from anywhere inside a site folder or by specifying the domain name.

```bash
fly start --domain example.com       # starts the website
fly stop --domain example.com        # stops the website
fly restart --domain example.com     # restarts the website
fly wp --domain example.com          # execute WP-CLI commands
fly logs --domain example.com        # view logs from all containers or a single one
fly restart <container> --domain example.com  # restart a container
fly exec <container> --domain example.com     # execute commands inside a container. Default: "php"
```

Or run the commands from within the site directory without specifying the domain:

```bash
fly start                   # starts the website
fly stop                    # stops the website
fly restart                 # restarts the website
fly wp                      # execute WP-CLI commands
fly logs <container>        # view logs from all containers or a single one
fly restart <container>     # restart a container
fly exec <container>        # execute commands inside a container. Default: "php"
```

### WP-CLI

**wp-cli**: To access `wp-cli`, use the following command from anywhere in the website folder or specify the domain name. The CLI will find the appropriate WordPress folder to execute the `wp` command.

```bash
fly wp --domain example.com
```

### Global Commands

A few helper commands to debug the server installation and start/stop all sites.

```bash
fly status                  # shows the status of the system
fly sites start             # starts all sites
fly sites stop              # stops all sites
fly sites restart           # stops and starts all sites
```
